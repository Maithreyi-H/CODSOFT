🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – 2025
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information such as:

Passenger Class (Pclass)

Gender (Sex)

Age

Fare

Number of Siblings/Spouses (SibSp)

Number of Parents/Children (Parch)

Embarked Port

Survival Status

🔍 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in Age and Embarked

Dropped Cabin due to excessive missing values

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed survival distribution

Compared survival by Gender and Passenger Class

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Created FamilySize feature

Encoded categorical variables

4️⃣ Model Building

Implemented the following models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

5️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning

Used GridSearchCV to improve model performance.
