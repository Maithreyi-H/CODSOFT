# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is part of the CODSOFT Internship Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction.

A machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given passenger data, predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm used: `Random Forest Classifier`
- Accuracy: ~80% (varies slightly due to randomness)

## 📊 Features Used
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Sex (Male/Female)
- Age
- Fare

## 📁 Files
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete model
- `README.md`: Project summary and details

## 📦 Dataset
Used dataset from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## ✅ Output
The model predicts survival with reasonable accuracy using selected features and RandomForest.

## 📌 Internship Task
This is Task 1 for the CODSOFT internship (Machine Learning Track).
